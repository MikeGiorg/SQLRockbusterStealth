## Introduction
Rockbuster Stealth LLC, a global movie rental company, is transitioning to an online video rental service. As part of the Business Intelligence (BI) department, I analyzed the company's data to support this shift and inform the 2020 strategy.
## Objectives
The management board required data-driven insights to answer:
<ol>
  <li> Which movies contributed the most/least to revenue gain?</li>
  <li>What was the average rental duration for all videos?</li>
  <li>Which countries are Rockbuster customers based in?</li>
  <li>Where are customers with a high lifetime value based?</li>
  <li>Do sales figures vary between geographic regions?</li>
</ol>

## Methodology 
Using SQL, I extracted, transformed, and analyzed data from the company's database to address these questions.
## Conclusion
The analysis provided actionable insights to guide Rockbuster Stealth's online rental strategy. The presentation and SQL scripts included demonstrate the comprehensive approach taken to inform the company's decisions.
